"bounce house"

a game for 2-(4, 6, 8?) players

bounce house is a competitive multiplayer game that's something like a cross between joust and bean dream. it's a side-scrolling game in which players are constantly bouncing, and have some control over how high they bounce (possibly through holding down a button for more/less bounce?). players defeat other players by falling into them from above, like joust.

to make things a little spicier, stages should have lots of dynamic platforming elements. these could include jump pads, spikes, and angled bounce elements that cause you to fly off at weird directions. some form of power ups would be fun to implement too.

some non-murder objective, like ctf or king of the hill, might be an interesting way to spice things up, especially for 2v2+ gameplay.

theoretically, this would be a good time to implement client-side movement control in pearl-networking. this way predictive netcode for a player's own movement could potentially be avoided. otoh, predictive or interpolated movement would be needed for other players.
